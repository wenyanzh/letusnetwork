        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>The gender gap in STEM begins with education. The Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that in 2016, women only made up approximately one-third of all recipients of STEM bachelor’s, master’s, and Ph.D. degrees. The fields of technology and engineering are especially male-orientated. Women in the United States made up less than one-quarter (24%) of those employed in STEM occupations in 2015. Moreover, certain high-tech jobs have a much bigger gap. In 2017, women in the United States accounted for less than 20% of those employed in high tech, including software developers(18.7%), computer network architects(4.2%), and aerospace engineers(8.9%). 
          <br><br>
        Our company, Let Us Connect, empowers and provides a platform for women from middle school, high school, and college to connect with mentees or mentors working in STEM fields. Having a mentoring system in place will help guide women in the right direction, giving them the necessary resources, and support into a successful career. This will allow them to feel more confident in their abilities to succeed. Our goal is to foster sisterhood, inspire the next generation of females to pursue a degree in STEM, and increase the number of women in the workforce.
